HEAVY IPv6 RA FLOODING ATTACK - DAMAGE ASSESSMENT
=================================================
Generated: Wed Jul 30 01:58:46 PM +06 2025
Attack Duration: 35 seconds
Total Monitoring Samples: 30

ATTACK CONFIGURATION:
- Total packets: 10,000 RA packets
- Attack waves: 3 simultaneous waves
- Thread count: 16 total threads
- Additional features: Fragments, random MTU, stealth mode
- Attack intensity: MAXIMUM

SYSTEM IMPACT:
- IPv6 addresses created: 157
- Final memory usage: 22%
- Final system load: 2.83
- System stability: SURVIVED

ATTACK EFFECTIVENESS:
✅ SUCCESS: Heavy attack achieved significant impact
   - Created 157 IPv6 addresses
   - Demonstrated system vulnerability under stress

WARNING SIGNS OBSERVED:
- High system load during attack
- Increased memory consumption  
- Potential network interface saturation
- Multiple concurrent attack processes

EVIDENCE FILES:
- heavy_attack_monitoring.csv: System performance data
- heavy_attack.pcap: Network packet capture
- attack*_output.log: Attack tool outputs
- *_attack_*.txt: System state comparisons

RECOVERY RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Monitor system stability after attack
2. Check for lingering high resource usage
3. Restart network services if needed
4. Reboot system if instability persists

⚠️  DISCLAIMER: This was an extreme stress test that may have
compromised system stability. Monitor system behavior closely.
