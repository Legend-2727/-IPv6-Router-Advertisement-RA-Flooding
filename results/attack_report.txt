IPv6 RA FLOODING ATTACK - DEMONSTRATION REPORT
==============================================
Generated: Wed Jul 30 01:53:53 PM +06 2025
Attack Duration: 3 seconds

NETWORK CONFIGURATION:
- Attacker: 2001:db8:cafe::1/64
- Victim: 2001:db8:cafe::2/64
- Test Environment: Isolated network namespaces

BASELINE STATE:
- Dynamic IPv6 addresses: 0
- Total IPv6 addresses: 2
- System limit (max_addresses):  16
- Baseline connectivity: 10/10 successful

ATTACK PARAMETERS:
- Packet count: 50 RA packets
- Attack method: Random prefix generation
- Thread count: Single-threaded
- Packet rate: Unlimited

ATTACK RESULTS:
- Dynamic addresses created: 14
- Final dynamic addresses: 14
- Final total addresses: 16
- System capacity used: 16/ 16 (100%)
- Post-attack connectivity: 10/10 successful
- Average response time: 81ms

ATTACK EFFECTIVENESS:
✅ SUCCESS: IPv6 address exhaustion demonstrated
   - Created 14 new IPv6 addresses
   - Consumed additional network resources
   - Demonstrated RA flooding vulnerability
ℹ️  NETWORK IMPACT: Minimal connectivity impact
   - Network remained largely responsive

EVIDENCE FILES:
- attack_monitoring.csv: Real-time monitoring data
- attack_packets.pcap: Network packet capture
- attack_output.log: Attack tool output
- attack_report.txt: This comprehensive report

INTERPRETATION:
This demonstration shows IPv6 Router Advertisement flooding attack
capability. The attack successfully creates multiple IPv6 addresses
by sending RA packets with unique prefixes, causing the victim to
perform SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) for each prefix.

The consistent creation of exactly 14 addresses demonstrates the
system's max_addresses limit (16 total: 2 baseline + 14 dynamic).
This represents successful IPv6 address space exhaustion.

SECURITY IMPLICATIONS:
- IPv6 address table exhaustion
- Potential routing table bloat
- Memory consumption on victim system
- Network monitoring evasion through multiple addresses
